# Mobile Deployment Fix for Vercel

## The Problem
Vercel shows "Import a different Git Repository" because it needs to connect to your GitHub repository first.

## Quick Solution

### Step 1: Connect Repository to Vercel
1. **Tap "Import a different Git Repository"**
2. **Search for:** `hyperflow-presale-live`
3. **Select:** hyperflowprotocol/hyperflow-presale-live
4. **Tap "Import"**

### Step 2: Deploy Settings
- **Project Name:** hyperflow-presale-live
- **Framework Preset:** Other (already selected)
- **Root Directory:** ./ (already set)
- **Build Settings:** Leave default (static site)

### Step 3: Deploy
1. **Tap "Deploy"** 
2. **Wait 1-2 minutes** for build
3. **Site goes live** at: hyperflow-presale-live.vercel.app

## Alternative: One-Click Deploy

**If repository import doesn't work:**
1. Go to: https://github.com/hyperflowprotocol/hyperflow-presale-live
2. Scroll to README
3. Click "Deploy with Vercel" button
4. Automatically imports and deploys
